      "\n",
      "| Aspect | What it means |\n",
      "|--------|----------------|\n",
      "| **Core technology** | I’m built on the GPT‑4 family of large language models. Think of me as a very big statistical pattern‑matcher that has read billions of words of text from books, articles, code, forums, and many other sources. |\n",
      "| **Training** | During training I was exposed to a wide variety of topics—science, history, art, programming, everyday life, and more—so I can generate text that is coherent, context‑aware, and often useful. I never “remember” specific documents, but I learn the statistical relationships between words and concepts. |\n",
      "| **Knowledge cutoff** | My training data goes up to **September 2021**, with a small amount of additional fine‑tuning data up to **June 2024**. Anything that happened after that (e.g., the latest news, brand‑new research, or recent product releases) may be unknown to me. |\n",
      "| **How I generate responses** | When you ask a question, I predict the next token (word‑piece) repeatedly, guided by the prompt you gave me and the patterns I learned. I try to keep the reply relevant, factual, and in the style you seem to prefer. |\n",
      "| **Strengths** | • Explaining concepts clearly<br>• Summarizing long texts<br>• Writing or editing prose, code, emails, etc.<br>• Brainstorming ideas<br>• Providing step‑by‑step problem solving |\n",
      "| **Limitations** | • I can hallucinate—produce plausible‑sounding but incorrect information.<br>• I don’t have real‑time internet access (unless a specific browsing tool is enabled, which isn’t the case here).<br>• I don’t have personal experiences, emotions, or consciousness.<br>• My knowledge is frozen at the cutoff date. |\n",
      "| **Safety & ethics** | I’m programmed to avoid generating harmful, illegal, or disallowed content (e.g., hate speech, instructions for wrongdoing, personal data about private individuals). If a request falls into those categories, I’ll either refuse or give a safe, minimal answer. |\n",
      "| **Interaction style** | I can adapt to many tones—formal, casual, technical, friendly, etc. Feel free to tell me how you’d like the response framed. |\n",
      "| **What I’m not** | • A human or a substitute for professional advice (legal, medical, financial, etc.).<br>• A source of private or proprietary data unless you provide it in the conversation.<br>• A perfect encyclopedia—always double‑check critical facts. |\n",
      "\n",
      "**In short:** I’m a text‑based AI assistant that can help you understand, create, and explore information across a huge range of subjects, while keeping in mind the boundaries of my training and the safety guidelines I follow. If you have a specific question or task, just let me know and I’ll do my best to help!\n"
